# Bryan Granse Devs Coding - Reusable Codes
This repo is my reusable codes built in react, from beginners to whatever, just for experimenting in basic or in advance who knows (this is writtend 2024 of December 6 around 3:35PM😁)

## List of Reusable Codes in React TypeScript
```bash
1. (hooks) React Responsive - Use to condition and determine if user is using specific breakpoint like 768px
for mobile etc then add a condition to implement specific class especially if you're using CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.
```
```bash
2. To use this code just import to any component
import { ChatWidget } from './ChatWidget';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your other components */}
      <ChatWidget />
    </div>
  );
}
```
